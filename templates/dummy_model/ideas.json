Modify the configure_optimizers function to assign different learning rates to different layers, with deeper layers having lower learning rates. Compare the training dynamics, convergence speed, and final performance with the baseline model.",

        "Experiment": "Modify the CausalSelfAttention class to implement a sparse attention mechanism using a fixed sparsity pattern, such as a sliding window that limits attention to a subset of neighboring tokens. Evaluate the impact on training efficiency (training time and memory usage) and model performance (perplexity and accuracy) compared to the baseline model. Ensure clear metrics for comparison and consider future extensions towards learned sparsity patterns based on initial findings.",
