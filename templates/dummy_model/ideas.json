Modify the configure_optimizers function to assign different learning rates to different layers, with deeper layers having lower learning rates.

This can be achieved by applying a learnable binary mask to the attention weights, allowing the model to learn which parts of the input are more relevant. The performance will be evaluated based on training loss and generation quality compared to the baseline model.",
